## Abstract
The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that around 466 million people have hearing loss worldwide. People with this disorder use sign language to communicate. However, most of the general public does not have the ability to understand sign language. This calls for innovative strategies to minimize the gap in communication between people. To address this issue, our team ComBridge  is developing a mobile app that leverages machine learning and computer vision to raise awareness of BISINDO among people with hearing impairments. The app provides interactive features and real-time feedback to help users learn and practice BISINDO characters, making the learning process engaging and effective. ComBridge aims to increase public awareness of BISINDO, bridge the communication gap, and foster a more inclusive society where people with hearing impairments can fully participate in social, educational, and economic activities.

Our main goal is to improve communication, increase access to essential services, and contribute to a society that values ​​linguistic diversity and inclusivity. By equipping individuals with BISINDO skills, ComBridge supports a broader view of social equality and community relations.

## Team Roles

### Machine Learning
The machine learning portion of our Capstone project involved training a sign language recognition model using transfer learning with MobileNetV2 in TensorFlow. The model was then optimized with TensorFlow Lite for mobile devices, using OpenCV for image processing and NumPy in the data processing pipeline.

### Mobile Development
In this project, we are focusing on front-end development using Figma to create UI/UX designs, wireframes, prototypes, and slicing. We will use Android Studio as the IDE and Kotlin as the programming language, utilizing several necessary libraries for application development.

### Cloud Computing
We will build the backend using Express.js framework that provides REST API auth endpoints and Node.js to manage user authentication and data. The backend and ML model will be deployed on Cloud Run. Then, GCP will support backend integration for data storage, management, and deployment.
